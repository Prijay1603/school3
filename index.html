                    BBQ and deliver a completely off-grid clean energy system. The system consists of 6 solar panels collecting
                    solar energy as well as driving area lighting, facial recognition security cameras with back to base monitoring,
                    BBQ heating elements for 10-hours continuous use at up to 300 degrees heat. All of this is capable of
                    being viewed and monitored via smart phone apps as an educational tool allowing the monitoring of all
                    aspects of energy capture, storage and consumption right down to component by component checks and

                    maintenance warnings i.e when the BBQ grease trap is full and in need of cleaning. This initiative was co-
                    sponsored by the ACT Government and EVT Energy and we will be officially launching the Solar Tree with

                    the ACT Government in Term One of 2021.</p>

                    to another project causing a manufacturing delay for our product. The following picture
